#+TITLE: VODAP-DCATAP-VALIDATION

* Introduction

Scripts to use the [[https://github.com/EmidioStani/dcat-ap_validator][dcat-ap validation rules]] to validate currently
available dcat-ap catalogs (to produce a report of the problems for a
given link).

The current scripts assume a relatively up-to-date ubuntu/debian
environment. The vagrant definition can be used to setup a basic test
environment if needed (including the docker/docker-compose
installation). Assuming [[https://www.vagrantup.com]["Vagrant"]][fn:1] is installed the following is all
that should be needed:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
vagrant up
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will start up virtualbox, install a ubuntu image and then install
the necessary tools.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Will will requrie virtualbox is also installed.
